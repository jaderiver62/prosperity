## Description

This project was created to provide a simple dashboard application for tracking funds through incoming and outcoming transactions. Prosperity can be used privately and offline on your PC following the steps in our [usage](#usage) section, or directly at our [webpage](https://serene-everglades-38825.herokuapp.com/).   

The application provides a working total for the funds and a table for all transactions.  Overall fund trends are graphed to create a visual for changes over time.

Finally, the Prosperity application also has the capability to function even when a user is knocked offline.  Our project is a functioning PWA (progressive web application) and will save your information for upload when the user is back online!

## Usage

To build the application on your own PC, you must have [Node.js](node link) and [npm](npm link) installed first.  First clone our repo, then navigate to the folder in your command line/Git Bash terminal.  Once there, run `npm install`, then `npm start`.  If everything went ok, you should see a message announcing your connection to the localhost!  To access the app simply go to [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/) in your web browser.
